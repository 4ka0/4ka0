### Hi there, I'm Jon 👋

A few things about me:

🤓 I'm seeking a fresh challenge as a backend engineer.
🌱 I'm currently learning Python, Django, and Django REST framework.
🤘 I’ve also dabbled a little with Ruby and quite liked it.
📚 I have an MSc in computer science (but that was a long time ago ... 🐢)
🗻 I've worked as a Japanese-to-English patent translator for about a decade.
☺️ I can't seem to stop using this wizard emoji in everything I write → 🧙‍♂️

The repos below should give you a good feel for where I'm currently at skill-wise and my learning journey so far - enjoy 🙂
