### Hi there, I'm Jon 👋

A few things about me:

- 🤓 I'm seeking a fresh challenge as a backend engineer.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python, Django, and Django REST framework.
- 🤘 I’m also using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Heroku, AWS (EC2, SES, S3), NGINX, Gunicorn, and PostgreSQL.
- 📚 I have an MSc in computer science where I used C and Java (but that was a long time ago ... 🐢)
- 🗻 I've worked as a Japanese-to-English patent translator for about a decade.
- ☺️ I can't seem to stop using this wizard emoji in everything I write → 🧙‍♂️

The repos below should give you a good feel for where I'm currently at skill-wise and my learning journey so far - enjoy 🙂
