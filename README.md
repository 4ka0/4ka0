### Hi there, I'm Jon ðŸ‘‹

<br>A few things about me:

- I enjoy building tools using Python and Django.
- I've worked as a Japanese-to-English patent translator for over a decade.
- I have an MSc in Computer Science where I mainly used C and Java (but that was a long time ago ...)
- I also have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Heroku, AWS (EC2, SES, S3), NGINX, Gunicorn, and PostgreSQL.
